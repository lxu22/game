-I feel like the center piece should be a base level that determines which tile in the first circle you progress to next, and in the first circle, you get introduced to a dream guide (should be one for each tile)(also, I am mad tempted to make one of them a magical schoolgirl O__O idk wat). Then the successive tiles contain the two dream guides who are adjacent to it. We shouldn't have to keep track of which one you started with, because in dreams, sometimes you automatically just know what's going on and take it as given. And then characters and scenery will randomly come and go with no sense of order. 
I'm kind of worried that it might seem TOO random, even if it is more accurate to how dreams progress. 

-...now I kind of want a bonus/epilogue stage if you clear everything, or maybe somehow have a "wake up" choice appear. So the character wakes up, goes to school, and has yet another boring-ass day. Or so it seems O__O It's boring for the character, but the dream guides should turn out to have real life counterparts XD I'd like for them to be either completely ordinary to the character or not even directly interacted with, but the player should recognize them and be like SLKJFLKDSJFLKSD haha
